    <h1>NVIDIA RTX Path Tracing</h1>
    <p><strong>NVIDIA</strong>, as depicted in <a href=https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/ultra-realism-made-accessible-with-ai-and-path-tracing-technologies/>this article</a>, has introduced new tools to make <strong>real-time path tracing</strong> accessible to developers and accelerate the creation of <strong>ultra-realistic game worlds</strong>. The <strong>DLSS Frame Generation</strong> is a new <strong>performance multiplier</strong> that uses <strong>AI</strong> to create entirely new frames, powered by the <strong>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs</strong> and the <strong>Optical Flow Accelerator</strong>. 28 top games and applications now use <strong>DLSS 3</strong> to deliver realistic graphics with incredible performance using frame generation technology, including <strong>A Plague Tale Requiem</strong>, <strong>Portal with RTX</strong>, and <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong>. In addition, <strong>Epic Games</strong> announced the <strong>DLSS Frame Generation</strong> plugin coming to <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> in its next release. <strong>NVIDIA</strong> has also released the <strong>RTX Path Tracing SDK</strong>, which accurately recreates the physics of all light sources in a scene.</p>
